// The README is this package's front page. The Go in it is not illustration; it is the first call
// most people will write, and they will copy it wholesale.
//
// Before this check nothing compiled it, and at the time it did not compile: the type
// `spicy.TaskRequest` did not exist (its real name is CreateTaskInput), `NewIdempotencyKey()`
// returns two values and was used as one, `CreateTask` was missing an argument and
// `WaitForTerminal` was missing one too. Five errors.
//
// This kind of failure emits no signal: the README renders fine, CI stays green, and only someone
// actually copying from it finds out - at the precise moment that forms their first impression of
// this SDK. Nor does anyone changing a signature get warned; the compiler cannot see Markdown.
//
// It is a *_test.go rather than a standalone program under scripts/ because this repository's CI
// runs exactly three commands - gofmt, go vet and go test (.github/workflows/ci.yml). Nothing would
// execute something placed in scripts/, which amounts to writing a check down and then switching it
// off.

// readmeSnippet is the compilation context for one Go block in the README.

	// name appears in failure messages.

	// anchor is a short piece of text unique to that block. It ties this table entry to that block
	// in the README: if someone reorders the blocks or inserts one in the middle, the check says
	// exactly which block no longer lines up instead of quietly compiling the wrong code against
	// the wrong context.
	anchor string
	// prelude supplies whatever the snippet assumes already exists. The README reads
	// continuously, each section carrying on with the previous one's variables; listing those here
	// is closer to how a reader actually copies than making every snippet build a client from
	// scratch.
	prelude string
	// sink consumes variables the snippet itself does not go on to use. In Go a declared-and-unused
	// variable is a compile error, whereas a documentation snippet is perfectly entitled to stop
	// partway.
	sink string
