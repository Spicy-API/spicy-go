// Package spicy is the official SpicyAPI client for Go.
//
// SpicyAPI serves image and video generation models behind one API. This package
// covers the asynchronous media workflow end to end: discover a model and its
// input schema, upload local reference material, quote a request, submit it, wait
// for a terminal state, and collect the result.
//
// Text models are deliberately out of scope. They speak the OpenAI, Anthropic and
// Gemini wire formats, so the established clients for those already work against
// this service; wrapping them here would add nothing.
//
// It depends on the standard library only.
//
// What it covers is the asynchronous generation pipeline: find a model and its
// input schema, quote it, create a task, poll that task to a terminal state,
// upload reference media, refresh an expired artefact link, and verify the
// webhook that announces a result. Text models are reached through the
// OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini compatible layers instead, where the official
// libraries work by changing only the base URL.
//
// Two things decide most of the code below:
//
//   - Every /api/v1 response is the {code,msg,data,request_id} envelope, and a
//     successful HTTP status does not mean the call succeeded. Branch on the
//     business code, never on the message text.
//   - HTTP 202 from task creation means accepted, not finished. Success or
//     failure is reported by the task's state, read back with GetTask.
//
// The contract this file is written against is published at
// https://docs.spicyapi.ai/openapi.yaml.
